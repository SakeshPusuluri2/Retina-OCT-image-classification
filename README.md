# Retina-OCT-image-classification
          Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the 
          retinas of living patients. Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation 
          of these images takes up a significant amount of time .Images are labeled as (disease)-(randomized patient ID)-(image number
          by this patient) and split into 4 directories: CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL.Our task is to develop an automated system which
          would classify the images into the different categories.
